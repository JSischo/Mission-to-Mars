# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose of the Project

>The purpose of this project was to use web scraping to gleen information from the NASA Mars website to create a locally hosted website that could be updated with the click of a button. The data on the website would then be updated with the most recent story about Mars from NASA with the featured image and some static images of MARS. To do this, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
